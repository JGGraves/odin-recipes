    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Winter always has me missing the sunshine, so I opt to make lemonade to remind me of the hot summer afternoons.
            What's a good lemonade without a fresh fruit syrup to go with it? After making fresh lemonade for the millionth time,
            I knew I needed an extra punch to change it up. This blueberry simple syrup was just the right addition!
